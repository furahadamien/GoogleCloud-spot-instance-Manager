Here are the titles of the projects.. I am proposing to you. Most are just titles and two with short descriptions. I will send you another version (may be with few more projects) with short descriptions for all projects. You can get started doing some investigation of these topics. I am going to give you some documentation on the GINI Cloud implementation.

After I post the full set of project descriptions, I will let you know the "bidding" process for the projects. 

================

SPOT 1: Spot Instance Manager in Google Cloud 

Google Cloud has different spot instance characteristics. This project is about 

designing and implementing a simple spot instance manager in Google Cloud. 

You could use only spot instances or on-demand and spot instances in conjunction

in this project. 

SPOT 2: Spot Instance Manager in GINI

We could extend the GINI Cloud implementation to include a “spot” computing 

platform. The spot instances would be capacity harvested from the student 

workstations in the Trottier Labs. We can put containers in background in the 

workstations when the machines are idle and pull the containers back when 

users log into the machines. This way the spot instances have unpredictable 

lifetimes. It is not exactly spot instances which is driven by markets and prices, but

some of the fault tolerance issues are shared with that problem. You can design

such a cloud design that is based on harvested resources from the workstations and make it part of GINI.
